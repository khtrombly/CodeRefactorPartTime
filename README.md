# CodeRefactorPartTime
Title: Code Refactor- Assignment 1

Description: 

The purpose of this project was to apply newly acquired knowledge of Html and CSS to currently existing code without changing the original purpose of the website. The initial code was provided from the Denver University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp Program and was stored to this Github Repository with my edits applied.

The changes made to the original code included adding in alt elements for accesibility, replacing div elements with semantic html elements, consolidating reptitive CSS, utilizing logical naming convention, adding in comments, and ensuring that the code is functional and easy to edit in under future circumstances.


Website Overview:

The following user story was completed during this project:

User story: As a Marketing Agency I wasnt a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines. 

The following is the acceptance criteria for the website:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Comments: 

This project was a second attempt at Code Refactoring and my second time using HTML, CSS, and the command terminal to create a deployed website.

Conclusion:

Completing this project allowed me to practice new skils in a circumstance that is similar to that which would be encountered in a professional setting. This project demonstrated the importance of testing code with each change including using Chrome Dev Tools to assist in testing.

In the future, I should start by creating a github repository rather than a local directory so that I can push more commits.
